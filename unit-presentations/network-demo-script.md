### Depoy Node HELM (master)

Deploy a NodeJS sample Helm Chart via the Helm CLI.
As a bonus fetch the chart locally and show where ports are set for the service and potentially change it.  Make a change to the index.html for the NodeJS sample

```
cloudctl login -a https://yourcluster:8443 --skip-ssl-validation

kubectl get po
helm repo list
helm search node
helm repo add ibm-stable https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable
helm install ibm-stable/ibm-nodejs-sample -n nodejs-demo --namespace networkdemo --tls
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

**Ping the Running Pod**

Next ping the IP of the pod shown from the master node

```
kubectl get po -o wide
ping -c 1 <ipaddress>
```

### IPTables

From the worker

```
iptables-save | grep nodejssample
```
### Routing Tables

From the worker

Note the IP and node the pod is running on from the `kubectl get po -o wide`

Log into that node

```
ip route
```

We can see the IP from the pod associated with an interface

```
ip addr list <interface>
```


Find the interface from above

### Subnets

Back on the master node

```
ip route
```

Now we see at the top all of the /26 pod subnets and the associated node

### Network Policy and IPTables 

From the Worker Node 
Back to the node running the pod
Find the interface for the pod using the IP of the pod and `ip routes`<<< Need this step>>>

```
iptables -L > file
vi file
```
Search for the "Chain <interface name> â€¦"

### Services

From the Master Node

```
kubectl get services -o wide
Kubectl describe service <your service here>
```

Show the **target port** from the pod
Show the **port*
Show the **node port**
Mention the Endpoint

```
curl http://serviceip:port
```

From your local browser

```
http://somenodeip:<nodeport>
```


Change the ip to another node

```
Master VIP = 172.16.52.60
Worker = 172.16.52.76
```





**Bonus:**
Deploy busybox

```
kubectl run --namespace=networkdemo busybox --rm -ti --image busybox /bin/sh
```

Exec into the container
Ping a service in that namespace by service name

```
ping nodes-service
```

Ping a service in another namespace by service.namespace

```
ping cam-proxy.services
```

While you are in there cat /etc/resolv.conf







```
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: busybox-policy
spec:
  repositories:
  - name: docker.io/busybox
    policy: null
EOF
```
